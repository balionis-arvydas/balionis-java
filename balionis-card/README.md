# Why?

### Task:

Implement a very basic virtual cash card in Java.
 
### Requirements:
1. Can withdraw money if a valid pin is supplied. The balance on the card needs to adjust accordingly.
2. Can be topped up any time by an arbitrary amount.
3. The cash card, being virtual, can be used in many places at the same time.
 
### Principles:
1.  Well tested code (test driven would be best)
2.  Write the code as you would write a part of a production grade system
3.  Requirements must be met but please donâ€™t go overboard

# How?

## Assumptions

1. You have gradle 3.2.1 installed.
2. You have java 8 installed.
3. (optional) Your maven repository is LOCAL_MAVEN_REPOSITORY=.\repository if you want to "install" artifact.

## Compile

```
gradle clean test jar
```

_Note: the artifact should be produced at balionis-card\build\libs\balionis-card-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar_

## Run

```diff
+ THIS IS NOT FOR PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. TODO: write launcher script.
```

```
gradle run -Dprofile=prod -Dexec.args="--server.port=8090"
```

_Note: If all goes well then the command line output should look like this_
```
